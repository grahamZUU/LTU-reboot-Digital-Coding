<p>This is example text showing how <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CS</strong>S work together to apply structure and presentation layer to content..</p> 

<p>This content would probably look better if it was a bit more spaced out and if certain key words or phrases were highlighted - maybe by making them a <em>different colour?>Hello world!
</em>
